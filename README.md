Bd808's Vagrant
===============

Vagrant and Puppet config to setup a local development VM the way I want it.

Nothing too crazy, new or exciting here. There may be some neat stuff buried
in the Puppet config, but if it's really fancy I probably cribbed it from
[MediaWiki Vagrant](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-vagrant) or
[Wikimedia's Puppet](https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet).
